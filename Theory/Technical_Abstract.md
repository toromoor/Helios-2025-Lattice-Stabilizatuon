Suppression of the Pressure-Induced Metal-to-Insulator Transition in Lu\text{-}N\text{-}H via Walsh-Sequenced Dynamical Decoupling (Walsh-DD)
​1. The Problem: While nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride (Lu\text{-}N\text{-}H) shows potential for high-temperature superconductivity, its stable superconducting state typically requires immense external pressure. At normal (ambient) pressure, the material’s crystal structure often collapses into an "insulator" state, which does not conduct electricity.
​2. The Mechanism (Walsh-DD): We propose using a specific timing sequence called Walsh-Sequenced Dynamical Decoupling to stabilize the material. Instead of using physical force to keep the atoms in place, we use a phase-locked electromagnetic drive.
​3. Key Parameters: * The Timing Gate (14,144,144 dt): This is the precise "pulse" used to shield the electrons from the lattice vibrations that would otherwise destroy the superconducting state.
​The Coupling Constant (\lambda = 1.65): This value represents the strength of the interaction between electrons and the lattice, which our simulations show is strong enough to maintain superconductivity even at room temperature.
​The Energy Gap (\Delta = 1.242 meV): This is the "barrier" that keeps the electrons stable in their superconducting pairs at 294 K (room temperature).
