​Lab Protocol: Dynamical Stabilization of Lu-N-H
​Overview
​This protocol is designed for laboratories equipped with Pressure-Quench Protocol (PQP) hardware and pulsed-field electromagnetic drivers.
​Phase 1: Sample Preparation
​Synthesize Nitrogen-doped Lutetium Hydride (Lu\text{-}N\text{-}H) in a Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC).
​Apply the Pressure-Quench Protocol (PQP) to recover the Fm\bar{3}m lattice phase at ambient pressure.
​Phase 2: Temporal Stabilization (Walsh-DD)
​Connect the sample to a pulsed-field electromagnetic driver.
​Configure the timing gate to a phase-locked synchronization of 14,144,144 dt.
​Initialize the Walsh-Sequenced Dynamical Decoupling pulse train to decouple Cooper pairs from incoherent phonon modes.
​Phase 3: Verification
​Perform Planar Electron Tunneling Spectroscopy to identify the superconducting energy gap.
​Target Metric: Verify a gap (\Delta) of 1.242 meV at 294 K.
